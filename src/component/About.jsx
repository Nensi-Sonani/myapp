        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
         It could be said that there’s gold in my veins. I was born into a family of jewelers; my father, his brothers, and their fathers were all jewelers. I even married a jeweler myself! Armed with ambition, family jeweling tradition, and a love of aesthetics I went off to college where I graduated with a degree in fashion design, with a minor in painting and drawing, but still found myself in the family studio working in the jewelry industry for the past 8 years, solely manufacturing jewelry being supplied to retailers across the country

      <p>Ultimately, it was my son’s birth gave me that extra push to carry the family custom made jewelry business online and start my own business. – he’s the main inspiration for everything I do. I combined my passion and training in fashion with my knowledge of jewelry and began sketching new styles. Shortly after, I decided to open FerkosFineJewelry.com to bring my designs to life.</p>
      <p>
      Ferko is a family nickname that my father gave me. He passed away when I was ten, but every day he serves as a constant source of inspiration and love. I named my gold jewelry shop after his loving nickname for me as a tribute to him.

      From creation to final polishing, I’m very hands on within the business. I design every piece with 3D CAD software and I handpick every diamond that is set into the jewelry to ensure that everyone fits our standards. I’m also responsible for all the photography you see. I’m proud to say that my photography skills are steadily improving and I may just have a new hobby.

      Family and art are my passion. In my spare time, you can find me spending time with my husband, son, and other friends and family. My main hobby is doing portraits in paint and pencil. I’m a maker by nature so I’m not happy unless I’m creating something; I really feel that art feeds my soul.

      Thank you for taking the time go get to know me. I hope you enjoy wearing my designs as much as I enjoy creating them for you!
